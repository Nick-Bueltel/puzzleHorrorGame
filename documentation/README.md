# Puzzle Horror - README

### Description 

Puzzle Horror is a "simple" puzzle game using JS, HTML, and CSS. The object of the game is to solve the puzzle that is displayed on the page, either with or without a time limit. Puzzles will idealy be solved with the use of scratch paper/text editor, gimp/photoshop, and a liberal application of google searches.

 ### Background 

I came up with the idea to code this game when I thought about games I had played in the past that left a lasting impression. Namely the one that inspired this game pretty directly was called "The Black Watchmen". The puzzles in that game involved using photoshop, google, wave spectrum analysis, geo matching, flight patter analysis, and other methods to solve. I wanted to create something a little bit more accessible to the average user.

### Getting started

https://nick-bueltel.github.io/puzzleHorrorGame/

click on the "Abandon Hope", or "Abandon All Hope" button to start the game.( note: "Abandon All Hope" is the harder difficulty, adding a 10 minute time limit per puzzle, as well as some additional audio cues. It is possible to beat a puzzle after the 10 minute limit, but be careful - you will lose 5 health per second over the time limit. )

Use google as well as gimp/photoshop, and other resources to solve the puzzle displayed on the screen. Type your answer in the input box and hit enter, or click the commit button.

Wrong answers will result in losing 5 health, you start with 50.
